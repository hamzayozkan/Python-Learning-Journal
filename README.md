# Python-Learning-Journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey
My name is Hamza Ozkan. I am a 2nd year college student enrolled at De Anza College and West Valley College. My hobbies include biking, hiking, tennis, and volleyball. I like cats more than dogs, but I think dogs are nice as well.
My goals for this course include taking my first steps toward writing proper and efficient code while learning about the logic behind object-oriented programming. After this class, I want to be able to create useful projects on my own.
